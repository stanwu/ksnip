&ast; xdg-desktop-portal screenshots are screenshots taken by the compositor and passed to ksnip, you will see a popup dialog that requires additional confirmation,
    the implementation can vary depending on the compositor. Currently, Snaps and Gnome Wayland `>= 41` only support xdg-desktop-portal screenshots, this is a
    limitation coming from the Gnome and Snaps, non-native screenshot tools are not allowed to take screenshots in any other way except through the xdg-desktop-portal.
    
# Installing Binaries
Binaries can be downloaded from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/releases). 
Currently, RPM, DEB, APT, Snap, Flatpak and AppImage for Linux, 
zipped EXE for Windows and 
APP for macOS in a DMG package are available.

### Continuous build
All supported binaries are built for every pushed commit, to be found at the top of the
release page. Continuous build artifacts are not fully tested and in most cases they are work in progress,
so use them with caution.

For Debian 10 and Debian 9, ksnip is available via [Debian Backports](https://backports.debian.org/).
Please enable `bullseye-backports` and `buster-backports` repo for Debian 10 and Debian 9 respectively before installing using `sudo apt install ksnip`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>ArchLinux</summary>

Ksnip is in the [Extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/ksnip/), so you can install it directly via pacman.
```
$ sudo pacman -S ksnip
```

If you want to build from the GIT repository, you can use the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ksnip-git/) (make sure you build the necessary dependencies too).
```
$ yay -S ksnip-git kimageannotator-git kcolorpicker-git
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Snap</summary>

The usual method for Snaps, will install the latest version:
```
$ sudo snap install ksnip
```

The continuous build version is also available as edge, in order to install it you need to provide the edge flag:
```
$ sudo snap install ksnip --edge
```

Snap startup time can be sped up and console output cleaned up from following error `Could not create AF_NETLINK socket (Permission denied)` by running the following commands:
```
$ snap connect ksnip:network-observe
$ snap connect ksnip:network-manager-observe
```

If you need to save screenshots to a removable media, the following additional connection is required:
```
$ snap connect ksnip:removable-media
```

This only needs to be done once and connects some Snap plugs which are currently not auto-connected.

  <summary>Homebrew Cask</summary>

Just install via Homebrew and start using from your "Applications" folder.

```
</details>

# Plugins
ksnip functionality can be extended by using plugins that need to be downloaded separately and installed or unpacked,
depending on the environment. Currently, under `Options > Settings > Plugins` a plugin detection can be triggered either
in the default location(s) or by providing a search path where to look for plugins. After clicking on "Detect", ksnip 
searches for known plugins and when found will list the name and version. 

### Default search locations  
Windows: `plugins` directory, next to `ksnip.exe`  
Linux/Unix: `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/local/lib64`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/lib64`  

### Version selection
The plugin must match the Qt version and build type of ksnip. If you have a ksnip version that uses Qt 15.5.X and was
build in `DEBUG` then the plugin must match the same criteria. In most cases the latest ksnip and plugin version will
be using the same Qt version, the only think that you need to watch out for is to not mix `DEBUG` and `RELEASE` build.

## OCR (Window and Linux/Unix)
ksnip supports OCR by using the [ksnip-plugin-ocr](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip-plugin-ocr) which utilizes Tesseract
to convert Image to text. When the OCR plugin was loaded, the OCR option becomes available under `Options > OCR`.
The latest plugin version can be found [here](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip-plugin-ocr/releases).


# Dependencies
ksnip depends on [kImageAnnotator](https://github.com/ksnip/kImageAnnotator) and [kColorPicker](https://github.com/DamirPorobic/kColorPicker) which needs
to be installed before building ksnip from source. Installation instructions can be found on the Github pages.

# Building from source
1. Get the latest release from GitHub by cloning the repo:
    `$ git clone https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip`
2. Change to repo directory:
    `$ cd ksnip`
3. Make new build directory and enter it:
    `$ mkdir build && cd build`
4. Create the makefile and build the project:
    `$ cmake .. && make`
5. Now install the application, eventually you need to run it with sudo:
    `$ sudo make install`
6. Run the application:
    `$ ksnip`

If you are using Archlinux, you may prefer to [build ksnip through AUR](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip#archlinux).

# Known Issues

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>

### X11
1. Snipping area with transparent background doesn't work when compositor is turned off, freeze background is used in that case.

### macOS
1. Snipping area with transparent background doesn't work, freeze background is always used. Issue [#151](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/151)
2. Second activation of snipping area doesn't get focus, you need to switch to the right side in order to see the snipping area. Issue [#152](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/152)
3. Mouse cursor is always captured. Issue [#153](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/153)

### Wayland
1. Portal and Native Screenshots not working under KDE Plasma `>= 5.80`. The issue is coming from a recent change in KDE 
Plasma that prevents access to DBUS Interfaces responsible for taking screenshots. This issue is going to be fixed in 
future Plasma releases for the Portal Screenshots. Workaround for making the Portal Screenshots work is adding the string 
`X-KDE-DBUS-Restricted-Interfaces=org.kde.kwin.Screenshot` to the 
`/usr/share/applications/org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde.desktop` file and then restarting. Don't forget to 
enforce Portal screenshots in settings. Issue [#424](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/424)
2. Under Gnome Wayland copying images to clipboard and then pasting them somewhere might not work. This happens currently
with native Wayland. A workaround is using XWayland by starting ksnip like this `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb /usr/bin/ksnip` or
switch to XWayland completely by exporting that variable `export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`. Issue [#416](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/416)
3. Native Wayland screenshots are no longer possible with Gnome `>= 41`. The Gnome developers have forbidden
access to the DBus interface that provides Screenshots under Wayland and leave non Gnome application only the possibility
to use xdg-desktop-portal screenshots. Security comes before usability for the Gnome developers. There is an open feature 
request to only grant screenshot permission once instead of for every screenshot, help us raise awareness for such feature 
[here](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/649).
4. Global Hotkeys don't work under Wayland, this is due to the secure nature of Wayland. As long as compositor developers
don't provide an interface for us to work with Global Hotkeys, does won't be supported.

### Screen Scaling (HiDPI)
1. Qt is having issues with screen scaling, it can occur that the Snipping area is incorrectly positioned. As a workaround
the Snipping Area position or offset can be configured so that it's placed correctly. Issue [#276]
</details>

### Snap
1. Drag and Drop might not be working when ksnip or the application that you drag and drop from/to is installed as snap.
the reason is that the image is shared via the temp directory which in case of snaps are restricted and every 
application can only see their own files or files of the user. The workaround for this is to change the temp directory 
location to a user owned directory like home, document or download directory via `Options > Settings > Application > 
Temp Directory`.

# Contribution
Any contribution is welcome, be it code, translations or other things. Currently, we need:
* Developers for writing code and fixing bugs for linux, windows and macOS. We have **only one developer** and the feature requests and bugs are pilling up.
* Testers for testing releases on different OS and Distros.
* Docu writers, there are a lot of features that the casual users don't know about.
